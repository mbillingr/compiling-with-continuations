- type lang
  - [ ] Traits to constrain generics 
    - [ ] Methods and associated functions

        How do they disambiguate interface functions (like `show`) for different types? 
      - [ ] Multi argument functions
      - [x] Multi argument lambdas
  - [ ] Multi argument enum constructors
- mini lambda
  - [x] let form
